##Chapter 2: Fundamental Data Types

Chapter 2 of C++ For Everyone introduces variables, constants, and several primitive data types, including integers and floating point numbers. Basic mathematical expressions are also discussed, and different libraries are used, including `<algorithm>` and `<cmath>`. 

With the introduction of variables, the concepts of receiving input from a user and processing that input are also explored. Whereas Chapter 1 asked for static programs, Chapter 2 expands on key programming concepts that make code more versitile. 

Comments and code layout are also covered with an emphasis on good practices. 

###Makefile

The [makefile](https://github.com/aalogancheney/CPlusPlus_For_Everyone/blob/master/Chapter_2/makefile) provided in this directory can be used to automatically compile the executables. See the [Chapter 1](https://github.com/aalogancheney/CPlusPlus_For_Everyone/tree/master/Chapter_1) directory for an explanation of how to use the makefile to compile code.

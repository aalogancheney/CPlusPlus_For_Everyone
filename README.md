#CPlusPlus_For_Everyone

##What?

[C++ For Everyone](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-EHEP001707.html)

Each of the chapters will be broken into directories with sample solutions to the problems. 

##Why?

To keep my C++ skills sharp as I re-review the language from the beginning. 

My goal is to have at least one meaningful commit per day.
